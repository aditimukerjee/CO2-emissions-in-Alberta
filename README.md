# CO2-emissions-in-Alberta

A dataset was extracted from https://archive.org/details/discussionpapero00albe_1/page/8/mode/2up 
This dataset was downloaded to discuss the CO2 emissions from various industries and fuel types in Alberta from 1988 to 2005.

The conclusions are:

- Alberta's energy industry closely followed by electricty generation are the highest emitters of CO2 emissions. The emissions by all these industries have been increasing over time. The CO2 emissions in Alberta in the energy sector alone were about 42 Megatonnes in 1988 and they increased to 65 Megatonnes by 2005 in just a matter of 9 years i.e. an increase of about 40%.

- The CO2 emissions by Energy sector far superceed every other sector be it residential, commercial etc. In 1988 the CO2 Emisions by the energy sector were 47 Mt of C02 and it has now increased to 65 Mt of CO2 while other sectors remain less 10 Mt of co2. It is no wonder that the Federal government is targeting the Energy industry in ALberta to reduce its CO2 emissions.

- Fuel Gas Followed by Coal are he biggest emitters of CO2 Emissions  in Alberta for the past 17 years. It is no wonder that the Alberta government has banned Coal and is trying agressively to reduce the CO2 emisisons from fuel gas.
